Bookstore Loyalty Program Code

Trish at Bargain Used Books has decided to add a discount program for her loyal customers and for customers that buy a lot. Here's how it works:
•	If a customer is in her loyalty program and buy $100 or less, they get a 15% discount.
•	If a customer is in her loyalty program AND they buy over $100, they get a 25% discount.
•	If a customer is not in her loyalty program but they buy over $100, they get a 5% discount.

NOTE: Some customers aren't eligible for discounts, and the program must account for that.

With every purchase, Trish also must charge 6% sales tax on the total AFTER any discount.

Write a program that calculates the cost for the total purchase:
•	Ask the user to enter the total purchase amount. NOTE: This number could be a floating point number.
•	Ask the user if the customer is in the loyalty program (see sample output).
•	Calculate the total after discounts
•	Calculate the amount of sales tax on the total.
•	Calculate the total after discounts and tax.
•	Output the total after discounts, the sales tax, and the total after discounts and tax. The program should format all money amounts that are output with 2 digits after the decimal point.
